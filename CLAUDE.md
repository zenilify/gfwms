# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal Python project containing a single main.py file with a basic "Hello World" style script. The project appears to be a template or starting point created in PyCharm.

## Code Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point containing a simple print function demonstration

## Development Commands

This project uses standard Python execution:

```bash
# Run the main script
python main.py
```

## Architecture Notes

This is a single-file Python project with minimal structure. The main.py file contains:
- A `print_hi()` function that takes a name parameter
- A main execution block that calls the function with 'Erick'
- PyCharm IDE-specific comments about debugging and execution
