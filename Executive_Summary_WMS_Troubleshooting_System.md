## 1. WHY: Business Case & Strategic Rationale

### Critical Business Drivers

**Operational Excellence Imperative:** Georg Fischer's warehouse management system handles critical supply chain operations where downtime directly impacts manufacturing productivity. Current troubleshooting relies on manual documentation and expert knowledge, creating single points of failure and inconsistent response times.

**Cost of Downtime:** Industry analysis shows WMS downtime costs average €10,000-50,000 per hour for manufacturing operations. Georg Fischer's complex multi-site operations amplify this risk, making rapid issue resolution a competitive necessity.

**Knowledge Management Crisis:** Critical troubleshooting expertise is concentrated among senior operators. The retirement of key personnel and increasing system complexity threaten operational continuity. A structured knowledge capture and transfer system is essential for business resilience.

**Digital Transformation Alignment:** This initiative supports Georg Fischer's Industry 4.0 strategy by implementing AI-powered predictive maintenance, real-time KPI monitoring, and data-driven decision making - core components of smart manufacturing.

### Strategic Objectives

1. **Reduce MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)** from 45 minutes to under 30 minutes
2. **Increase First-Call Resolution Rate** from 65% to 85%
3. **Establish Knowledge Continuity** through systematic documentation and training
4. **Enable Predictive Maintenance** using AI-powered trend analysis
5. **Standardize Support Processes** across all Georg Fischer facilities
